## Description

Movie Tracking System helps users to search the movie database and filter results based on genre preferences.

## Technologies Used:

React (version 18.2.0)
BootStrap (Version 5.3.2)
npm (Node package manager)

## Design Decisions

### Search Functionality:

Users can search the movie database by title using a search bar located prominently at the top of the page.
The search algorithm is optimized to provide fast and relevant results as users type their queries.

### Filter Option:

As a bonus feature, a filter option is provided to refine movie results based on genre preferences.
Users can select genres from a dropdown menu to narrow down their search results.

### Pagination:

Segregated/Divided large amounts of data in to pages using pagination technique.

### Error Handling:

The application handles errors gracefully, providing feedback to users in case of no search results.

### Accessibility:

I have ensured that the application is accessible to users on any screens by implementing proper HTML semantics.

## Challanges Faced

1. Integration with External Data:

Parsing and integrating the external dataset into the React application with careful handling and validation.

2. Optimizing Search Performance:

Ensuring fast and efficient search functionality, especially with a large dataset, posed challenges that required performance enhancement techniques like pagination.

3. Responsive Design:

Achieving a responsive design that works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

4. Maintaining Code Quality:

Ensuring clean, maintainable and Reusable code was a continuous effort throughout the development process.
